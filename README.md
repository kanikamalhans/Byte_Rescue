"A sustainable solution to the dual problem of food waste and hunger, by linking surplus food from food establishments with local organizations serving those in need."
The project has the potential to not only address the issue of food waste and food insecurity but also contribute towards the sustainable development goal of "Zero Hunger". By bringing together all the stakeholders in the food system, the project aims to create a more sustainable, equitable, and resilient food system.
